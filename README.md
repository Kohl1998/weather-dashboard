# Weather Dashboard

## Description

For this application I created a weather dashboard that helps users with the forecast for the next 5 days with various cities for example Berlin, London, & New York. 

During the process of building this application I learnt how important it is to become resourceful with peers, & Google when you find yourself struggling to come up with solutions. Also, I really learnt how important it is to understand documentation when using server side API's, as this helped me to format my URL. 

## Installation

I setup a remote repo on Github to work from, which I then cloned to my local repository so I can have the two in sync. 

Afterwards, I used vscode which is an integrated development environment which allowed me to update the software code, but also see the code in action using the live server extension. 

Lastly, once I was done I pushed all the updates to my remote repository from my local repo using commits, and once I was happy I deployed the changes to the live website.

## Usage

To utilise the application the user has to type in a city, to see the current weather conditions, over the next 5 days.
